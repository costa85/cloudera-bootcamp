## <center>A Note on Service Deployment</center>

* Plan on relocating services as clusters grow
* Cloudera Professional Services uses four role types to guide service placement and other concerns 
    * Master: Dispatching and supervisory processes
        * HDFS NameNode, YARN ResourceManager, HBaseMaster
    * Worker: Task executors
        * DataNode, NodeManager, HBase RegionServer
    * Edge: Client access, data ingestion
        * HUE, Flume, Sqoop, client gateways, NFS gateways
    * Utility: Administration, management services
        * Cloudera Manager, database server
* Deployment scheme varies with cluster size
    * Few nodes: master & workers combined, utility & edge roles combined 
    * Many nodes: masters and works separated, dedicated utility & edge node(s)
    * Many nodes: masters and workers separated, dedicated utility & edge node(s)
    * You may see different hardware types for each role
        * Fewer disks, RAID volumes on master nodes
        * More RAM and spindles on worker nodes

## <center> <a name="hdfs_namenode_ha"/> NameNode HA

* CM 5 offers a [NameNode HA wizard](http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera-content/cloudera-docs/CM5/latest/Cloudera-Manager-Managing-Clusters/cm5mc_hdfs_hi_avail.html)
    * In CML *{HDFS service} -> Actions -> Enable High Availability*
    * You'll need to [place the Journal Quorum Managers](http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera-content/cloudera-docs/CM5/latest/Cloudera-Manager-Managing-Clusters/cm5mc_hdfs_hi_avail.html?scroll=cmug_topic_5_12_1_unique_1)
    * You should [understand Zookeeper's role in maintaining state] (https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HDFSHighAvailabilityWithQJM.html)

## <center> <a name="hdfs_benchmarking"/> Benchmarking

* Benchmarking: smoke test or performance test?
* Common tools used in the field
    * [TeraSort Suite: teragen, terasort, teravalidate](http://www.michael-noll.com/blog/2011/04/09/benchmarking-and-stress-testing-an-hadoop-cluster-with-terasort-testdfsio-nnbench-mrbench/#terasort-benchmark-suite)
    * A few use [TestDFSIO](http://www.michael-noll.com/blog/2011/04/09/benchmarking-and-stress-testing-an-hadoop-cluster-with-terasort-testdfsio-nnbench-mrbench/#testdfsio)
* For more robust performance testing    
    * [<strong>S</strong>tatistical <strong>W</strong>orkload <strong>I</strong>njector for <strong>M</strong>apReduce](https://github.com/SWIMProjectUCB/SWIM/wiki) (SWIM)    
    * Used by Cloudera's Partner Engineering
    * Not a ready-to-deploy field tool
* Consider testing the NameNode first: [nnbench](http://www.michael-noll.com/blog/2011/04/09/benchmarking-and-stress-testing-an-hadoop-cluster-with-terasort-testdfsio-nnbench-mrbench/#namenode-benchmark-nnbench)

[Michael G. Noll's blog post](http://www.michael-noll.com/blog/2011/04/09/benchmarking-and-stress-testing-an-hadoop-cluster-with-terasort-testdfsio-nnbench-mrbench/) reviews many of these tools (not SWIM).

### <center> Repeating a query (cache effect)

<img src="http://blog.cloudera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/hdfs-cache-f1.jpg">

---
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## <center> Problem: Performance on Repeated Queries

* The NameNode knows which DataNodes stores which blocks
    * It doesn't know [which nodes currently have them cached](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-4949)
    * A repeat job could pay disk I/O cost up to three times
    * This cost is arguably transparent to MapReduce jobs
    * With [Impala](http://impala.io/) or other NRT use cases, however, lag is  notable
        * Common ad hoc queries => double- and triple-caching

## <center> Solution: [HDFS Read Caching](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2014/08/new-in-cdh-5-1-hdfs-read-caching/)
    
Adds cache locality to NN reports<p>

* Specify to the NN a HDFS file/directory you want cached
* The DN receives a cache command and pulls the data into memory
    * Will cache block copies up to the replica limit
    * Stored off-heap: no impact on DataNode GC
* Cache-local clients can be made aware of this advantage <a href="#scr_and_zcr">one of two ways</a>:
    * Short-circuit read (SCR) API
    * Zero-copy read (ZCR) API

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## <center> Directory caching: Roles and responsibilities

* HDFS admin
    1. Create a cache pool (used to enforce quotas)
    2. Assigns directive(s)
    3. CLI: <code># sudo -u hdfs hdfs cacheadmin ...</code>
    4. Can add/modify/remove cache pools & directives, list stats
* DataNodes
    1. Maps blocks to system memory as requested
    2. Report cached state to NameNode
* Job client
    1. Queries NN for DNs with cached blocks
    2. Uses Zero Copy Read (ZCR) or Short Circuit Read (SCR) API

## <center> Directory caching: Other notes

* [Caching documentation is here] (http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cdh_ig_hdfs_caching.html)
* The follow-on question: how do we balance memory demand between this and other memory-hungry features? 
    * MR jobs favor parallel efficiency, low cost, simple scheduling
    * Query users have ["NRT" expectations](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5267231/what-is-the-definition-of-realtime-near-realtime-and-batch-give-examples-of-ea)
    * We'll detail this subject when we discuss YARN and resource management

## <center> <a name="scr_and_zcr"/> Technical Notes on SCR and ZCR

* General advice: take time to map key upstream features to their [JIRAs] (https://issues.apache.org/jira)
* [Short-circuit Reads] (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-2246)
    * Lets a client examine the local DataNode's process map for data blocks in system cache
    * Uses [file descriptor passing](http://poincare.matf.bg.ac.rs/~ivana/courses/tos/sistemi_knjige/pomocno/apue/APUE/0201433079/ch17lev1sec4.html) 
    * [Configurable via CM](http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/documentation/core/latest/topics/admin_hdfs_short_circuit_reads.html) 
* Zero-copy Read
    * [Uses mmap() to read system page$](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-4953)
    * Client implements the [ZCR API](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-5191) 
* On the roadmap
    * Write caching: [HDFS-5851](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-5851)
    * Proposed enhancement: dynamic caching based on workload/hints

## <center> <a name="hdfs_dir_snapshots"/> HDFS Snapshots

* Capabilities
    * Lets user with write permissions retrieve a deleted file
    * Lets users track additions to a directory over time
    * Uses [copy-on-write](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) to associate NN directories with DN block locations + timestamp 
    * Deleted files may be retrieved from a version folder
    * Similar to .Trash concept, but no expiration
    * Subdirectories are included
* [Apache docs on the CLI](http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh5/cdh/5/hadoop/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsSnapshots.html) 
* [Snapshots using Cloudera Manager] (http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_bdr_snapshot_intro.html) requires an active trial or Enterprise license

## <center> HDFS Problems/Diagnoses/Solutions

### <center>HDFS Labs Overview

* Replicate data to a classmate's cluster 
* Use teragen and terasort to smoke-test your cluster
* Configure NameNode HA
* Snapshot, delete, and recover a file

---
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## <center> HDFS Lab: Replicate to another cluster

* Choose a partner in class
* Create a replication directory named after your partner's GitHub name
* teragen 1 GB of records
* Replicate your partner's teragen file to the directory your made for them 
* Using the HDFS Browser in Cloudera Manager, get a screenshot that shows your partner's file
    * Name this file <code>storage/0_<partnerGitHub>_<yourGitHub>.png</code>

---
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## <center> HDFS Lab: Test HDFS performance

* Run <code>terasort</code> twice
    * Use the <code>time</code> command to capture each run's duration
    * Use the file you created with <code>teragen</code> in the previous lab
    * To use one directory for all runs, remember to delete the previous job's output
* Enable HDFS Short Circuit Reads, and run one more <code>terasort</code>
* Record the output and duration of all jobs
    * Replace all map/reduce percentage output lines in each job with one line that reads [###Job Progress###]
    * Place all this in the file <code>storage/1_terasort_tests.txt</code>
